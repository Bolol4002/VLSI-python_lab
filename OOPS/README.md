## Learning Outcomes

| # | Outcome | CO |
|---:|---|:--:|
| 1 | Implement business logic using combinations of decision-making and loops. | CO5 |
| 2 | Implement loops to generate sequences. | CO5 |
| 3 | Apply different types of operators to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical decisions, and more. | CO5 |
| 4 | Apply the concept of arrays to store, access, and manipulate collections of data effectively in real-world programming. | CO5 |
| 5 | Apply these concepts to define custom data types, create objects, and call methods to perform various operations. | CO5 |
| 6 | Analyze how constructors work, compare different types, and implement them effectively to build well-initialized, object-oriented programs. | CO5 |
| 7 | Analyze the use of method overloading, differentiate it from other forms of polymorphism, and implement overloaded methods based on problem requirements. | CO2 |
| 8 | Analyze how inheritance helps in reducing code duplication. | CO5 |
| 9 | Apply and compare the use of single vs. multiple interfaces in designing scalable systems. | CO5 |
| 10 | Design and implement applications using custom packages. | CO5 |
| 11 | Examine the use of `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`. | CO5 |
| 12 | Implement programs using `StringBuffer` methods to perform various operations dynamically. | CO5 |
| 13 | Examine how different collection classes behave with respect to ordering, duplicates, and performance. | CO5 |
